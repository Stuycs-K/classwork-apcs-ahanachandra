//When we made the change to the getName accessor method, the new getName changed the result of speak, adding "The Mighty" to it.
//This is because speak uses accessor methods in order to print the string.
//If the accesor method changes, we will see a different result printed.
//Bird b2 = new Animal() returned an error because the animal parameter input does not include the information needed for the Bird Class.
//This implies Animal does not have a is-a relationship with Bird unlike the relationship Bird has with Animal.
